# ML Model Implementation

## Objective
In this guide, we aim to build a clean machine learning model to analyze the relationship between weather and food cravings. We will follow a step-by-step approach covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, training, and evaluation. This guide also includes four hypotheses to test along with their corresponding statistical analyses.

## Hypotheses
1. **H1**: Individuals crave more comfort foods during colder weather.
2. **H2**: High temperatures lead to an increase in cravings for light, refreshing snacks.
3. **H3**: Rainy weather is associated with increased cravings for sweet foods.
4. **H4**: Seasonal variations in weather conditions affect overall food cravings throughout the year.

## Step 1: Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on weather conditions and corresponding food cravings. This could be done through APIs or datasets from reliable sources.
2. **Cleaning Data**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency in data formats.
3. **Data Transformation**: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.

## Step 2: Feature Engineering
1. **Create New Features**: Extract important features from the weather data that may influence food cravings, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation levels.
2. **Lagged Features**: Consider adding lagged features that represent the previous day's weather condition to evaluate its effect on cravings.

## Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Visualizations**: Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as scatter plots and heatmaps to understand relationships between weather and food cravings.
2. **Statistical Tests**: Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to observe significant differences in cravings based on different weather conditions.

## Step 4: Model Selection
1. **Select Algorithms**: Choose appropriate algorithms for the task. Consider regression models for continuous outcomes or classification models for categorical cravings.
2. **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation to validate model performance.

## Step 5: Model Training
1. **Split Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Train Models**: Use the training set to train your selected models.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters using Grid Search or Random Search.

## Step 6: Model Evaluation
1. **Testing**: Evaluate model performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification, or RMSE and R² for regression.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Analyze the results statistically to determine the significance of findings related to the hypotheses.

## Conclusion
Summarize the findings of the analysis and discuss implications for future research in the area of food cravings and weather influence.
