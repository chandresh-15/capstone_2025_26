🌦️🍔 Weather & Food Craving Relationship
Capstone Project — Data Analytics for Business

This project explores the relationship between weather conditions and food cravings using historical weather data from Meteostat and restaurant review data from Yelp. Our goal is to analyze whether certain weather patterns (temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.) influence the type of food people prefer or search for.

🔍 Project Overview

In this capstone project, we:

Collect historical daily weather data for selected locations using the Meteostat API.

Extract and clean restaurant review data from the Yelp dataset.

Perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Build visualizations and predictive models to uncover relationships between weather conditions and food cravings.

Determine if weather influences:

Food categories (e.g., spicy, cold, drinks, desserts)

Review sentiment

Customer behavior patterns
